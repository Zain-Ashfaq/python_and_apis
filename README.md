# API Notes
## What are APIs?

APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) are a set of rules and protocols that allow different software applications to communicate and interact with each other.
APIs define the methods and data formats that applications can use to request and exchange information, services, or functionality.

## How are APIs used and why are they popular?

* Used to enable communication and integration between different software systems, allowing them to share data and functionality.
* Provide a standardized and structured way for applications to interact, reducing the complexity and effort required for integration.
* They are popular because they enable developers to leverage existing services and functionalities without having to build everything from scratch.
* Promote modularity, re-usability, and collaboration by allowing developers to build on top of existing APIs and create new applications.
